We imagined that our users would each have custom needs \r\n                    in terms of what data was most important to them. Companies or regulators are dealing with vast \r\n                    amounts of data and ever changing regulations, so we wanted our interface to be customizable, \r\n                    simple, and insightful.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    Read more about Carbon Chain <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/carbonchain-is-using-ai-to-determine-the-emissions-profile-of-the-worlds-biggest-polluters/\">here</a>.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"section\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"heading\">Design Process</h2>\r\n\r\n            <div>\r\n            <h3 class=\"btext\">Wireframes</h3>\r\n            <p class=\"btext\">We first created a wireframe for our design based off four sketches.</p>\r\n            <div class=\"display\">\r\n                <iframe class=\"iframe\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FsnmtD1Uac7SLiRDbREhEB7%2FWireframes%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n            </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div>\r\n            <h3 class=\"btext\">Hi-fi Mockups</h3>\r\n            <p class=\"btext\"> Once we decided on wireframes we liked, we converted the design into a high fidelity prototype using Figma. </p>\r\n            <h4 class=\"btext\">Crit Feedback</h4>\r\n            <p class=\"btext\"> After our first iteration of our high fidelity prototype, we participated in a critique with around 10 other students and a professional UI/UX designer.

Most users identified the main tasks you can perform on the site in terms of what information you can view. When users were asked where they would go to edit a supply chain, there was something outside of our expectations. Two users indicated that they thought clicking on the drop down menu on “All Chains” on the dashboard would take them to the supply chain. The only other mistake a user made was a misunderstanding that it was a prototype and not a website. Overall the users did well on the subtasks.</li>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                <li class=\"btext\">The gifs above demonstrate the ways users tried to navigate to the supply chain page</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                <li class=\"btext\">One potential interface change could be changing the language on the “You are viewing section.” This was intended to allow users to quickly customize their dashboard view, however, it seemed that users interpreted it more as a navigation. One option could be change the title to “Change View,” add some more instructional copy \r\n                (at least for first time users) or incorporate it into the customize dashboard button at the top. Based on the written feedback, we also could include more icons and add back in our compare feature.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            </div>\r\n            {/* <script src=\"app.js\"></script> */}\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <Footer/>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  export default CarbonChain;","C:\\Users\\ellie\\onedrive\\documents\\uiux\\portfolio\\portfolio\\src\\ScrollToTop.jsx",[],{"ruleId":"87","replacedBy":"88"},{"ruleId":"89","replacedBy":"90"},{"ruleId":"91","severity":1,"message":"92","line":12,"column":11,"nodeType":"93","endLine":14,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"91","severity":1,"message":"92","line":15,"column":11,"nodeType":"93","endLine":17,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"91","severity":1,"message":"92","line":18,"column":11,"nodeType":"93","endLine":20,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"94","severity":1,"message":"95","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"96","messageId":"97","endLine":2,"endColumn":17},{"ruleId":"94","severity":1,"message":"98","line":4,"column":8,"nodeType":"96","messageId":"97","endLine":4,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"91","severity":1,"message":"92","line":26,"column":13,"nodeType":"93","endLine":26,"endColumn":48},{"ruleId":"91","severity":1,"message":"92","line":35,"column":17,"nodeType":"93","endLine":35,"endColumn":53},{"ruleId":"94","severity":1,"message":"99","line":7,"column":8,"nodeType":"96","messageId":"97","endLine":7,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"94","severity":1,"message":"100","line":8,"column":8,"nodeType":"96","messageId":"97","endLine":8,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"94","severity":1,"message":"101","line":9,"column":8,"nodeType":"96","messageId":"97","endLine":9,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"94","severity":1,"message":"102","line":10,"column":8,"nodeType":"96","messageId":"97","endLine":10,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"103","severity":1,"message":"104","line":53,"column":17,"nodeType":"93","endLine":53,"endColumn":204},{"ruleId":"103","severity":1,"message":"104","line":112,"column":17,"nodeType":"93","endLine":112,"endColumn":237},"no-native-reassign",["105"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["106"],"jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","no-unused-vars","'NavLink' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'ScrollToTop' is defined but never used.","'dashboard1' is defined but never used.","'dashboard2' is defined but never used.","'dashboard3' is defined but never used.","'dashboard4' is defined but never used.","jsx-a11y/iframe-has-title","<iframe> elements must have a unique title property.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
